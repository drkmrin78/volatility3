"""Automagic modules allow the framework to populate configuration elements that a user has not provided.

Automagic objects accept a `context` and a `configurable`, and will make appropriate changes to the `context` in an
attempt to fulfill the requirements of the `configurable` object (or objects upon which that configurable may rely).

Several pre-existing modules include one to stack layers on top of each other (allowing automatic detection and
loading of file format types) as well as a module to reconstruct layers based on their provided requirements.
